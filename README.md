# -----------------------------------

Personal project dedicated to learning and working with vanilla javascript to achieve small things which built to big ones. Criticism, contributions &/or suggestions welcome. 

Using parceljs as bundler and ES6 to take advantage of js new features. To test go into /dist folder and run index.html in your browser (pssst report any bugs ;) ... ). 

In order to see underlying code, its the /src you wanna check out.
